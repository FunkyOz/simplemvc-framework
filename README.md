## SimpleMVC

[![Build status](https://github.com/simplemvc/framework/workflows/PHP%20test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ezimuel/SimpleMVC/actions)

**SimpleMVC** is an MVC framework for PHP based on the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle:
> "Keep It Simple, Stupid"

The goal of this project is to offer a simple and fast [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
framework for PHP applications.

It uses the [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) principle to manage
the dependencies between classes and the [FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute) library
for implementing the routing system.

SimpleMVC uses the following PSR standards, from the [PHP-FIG](https://www.php-fig.org/) initiative:

- [PSR-11](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/) for DI Container;
- [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) for HTTP message;
- [PSR-3](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/) for logging;

This project is used in the course **PHP Programming** by [Enrico Zimuel](https://www.zimuel.it/) at [ITS ICT Piemonte](http://www.its-ictpiemonte.it/),
an Italian tertiary educational institution specialized in Information and Communications Technology in [Turin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin).
